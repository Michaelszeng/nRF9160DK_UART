nRF9160DK_UART
###########

Basic firmware that demonstrates UART TX and RX using nRF9160DK (TX Pin: P0.01; RX Pin: P0.00).

This has been tested with an nRF7002DK, wired like so (ignore the LED strip that is also wired to the nRF7002DK): https://github.com/Michaelszeng/nRF9160DK_UART/blob/master/IMG_4940.jpg
