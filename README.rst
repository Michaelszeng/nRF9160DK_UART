nRF9160DK_UART
###########

Basic firmware that demonstrates UART TX and RX using nRF9160DK (TX Pin: P0.01; RX Pin: P0.00).

Build with nrf9160dk_nrf9160_ns.

This has been tested with an nRF7002DK (the nRF7002DK must run `different firmware <https://github.com/Michaelszeng/nRF7002dk-UART>`_), wired `like so <https://github.com/Michaelszeng/nRF9160DK_UART/blob/master/IMG_4940.jpg>`_ (ignore the LED strip that is also wired to the nRF7002DK).

NOTE: THE IMAGE IS WRONG. CHANGE P0.16 TO P0.17 AND CHANGE P0.15 TO P0.16

Open a serial terminal (115200 baud) for each DK to see the outputs.
